# Matha Fresh Data Intelligence Dashboard

**Transforming Sales Data into Growth Opportunities**

---

## Introduction

At Matha Fresh, we believe data isn’t just numbers—it’s the story of our customers, our products, and our growth. To bring these stories to life, I developed an end-to-end analytics pipeline and Power BI dashboard that reveals exactly what’s driving our success. This project integrates data from our e-commerce platform ([mathafresh.com](https://mathafresh.com/)) using SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI, and translates it into clear, actionable business insights for our team.

## Data Collection & Preparation

### 1. Data Extraction (SQL)
- Exported all sales, product, customer, and payment data (2024–2025) directly from our website database.
- Ensured completeness by joining relevant tables and pulling granular transactional details.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Merging (Python & Excel)
- Combined and harmonized datasets using Python (pandas) and Excel.
- Standardized product names, dates, and payment methods, ensuring consistency and accuracy for analysis.
- Dealt with missing, duplicate, or incorrect entries to guarantee trustworthy reporting.

### 3. Data Structuring (Excel)
- Created summary tables and grouped key features (product, postcode, date, payment).
- Explored early trends—such as top-selling items and busiest order days—to guide deeper Power BI modeling.
